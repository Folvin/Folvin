hey there, I'm Kevin Alessi, I was born in 2002 I'm both a logic person and emotional, I find that balance is a good way to do everything, i like to play videogames and hearing to music to relax, I also enjoy to hang out with my friend and adventure a bit, always trying new things from times to times. I started programming thanks to an intensive course of 6 month called develhope, I liked it from the start and now I'm just curious to know what will I learn in the future.

my biggest aspiration is to develop a videogame that i can be proud of
