Hi! I'm a full-stack developer who likes to discover and learn new things, so even if I'm a web developer, I wouldn't mind learning other things like developing applications, UI design, AI, video games, etc... I don't like doing the same thing over and over again so when I face a problem I don't just pick the usual solution instead, I tend to analyze the problem and see every possible solution (even the weird ones) and choose the most optimal and simple one. We could say I'm a bit lazy and I don't like to overcomplicate things. I tend to keep it simple but also reusable (cause, y'know, I do not want to rewrite what I already wrote since I'm lazy). I'm playful and like to talk a lot and tend to view things analytically, maybe too much sometimes. I enjoy video games and teamwork, I just usually support others whenever I can and this is also true outside of video games, I'm a team player who likes to support whenever I can. I hope to work in an honest place and with people who love coding like me and that can take a pun or two (I'm a bit malicious there *wink*).
