hi! i'm a fullstack developer who likes to discover and learn new things so even if i'm a web developer i wouldn't mind to learn other things like developing application, UI design, AI, Videogames etc... I don't really like doing the same thing over and over again so when i face a problem i don't just pick the usual solution instead i like to analyze the problem and see every possible solution (even the weird ones) and pick the most optimal and simple, we can say i'm a bit lazy so don't really like to overcomplicate things i tend to keep it simple but also reusable (cause y'know i dont want to rewrite what i already wrote since I'm lazy). I'm playful and likes to talk a lot and I tend to view things analytically maybe too much sometimes. i enjoy videogames and teamworking i just usually support others whenever i can and this is also true outside of videogames I'm a teamplayer who likes to support whenever i can. i hope to work in an honest place and with people who loves coding like me and that can take a pun or two (I'm a bit mischievous there *wink*).
