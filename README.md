Hello there, I'm Kevin Alessi. I was born in 2002. I'm a logical and emotional person. I think that balance is the key to making things right. I like to play video games and hearing to music to relax. I also enjoy hanging out with my friend and adventure a bit, always trying new things from time to time. I began programming thanks to an intensive course of 6 months called Develhope. I liked it from the beginning, and now I'm just curious to know what I will learn in the future.

My biggest aspiration is to develop a videogame or software that I can be proud of
